klimalogg - WeeWX driver for TFA KlimaLogg Pro
Copyright 2016 Luc Heijst

Klimalogg is a weewx extension to read data from the KlimaLogg Pro station
and up to 8 thermo/hygro sensors. It saves data to its own database, then
those data can be displayed in weewx reports.  This extension also includes
a sample skin that illustrates how to use the data.

Installation instructions:

1) Install weewx, select Simulator as the weather station

  http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm

2) Download the klimalogg driver

  wget -O weewx-kl.zip https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-klimalogg/archive/master.zip

3) Install the klimalogg driver and skin

  wee_extension --install weewx-kl.zip

4) Replace the simulator driver with the klimalogg driver

  wee_config --reconfigure --driver=user.kl --no-prompt

5) Restart weewx:

  sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
  sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start


Beware that this installation process will modify weewx.conf:

  Change wx_binding to kl_binding.  Klimalogg works best with its own schema,
  not the wview schema that is the default for weewx.  This requires changing
  the data binding from wx_binding to kl_binding in two places, the StdReport
  and StdArchive sections

  Remove the [Simulator] driver section if it exists.

  Remove the [[StandardReport]] section of [StdReport] if it exists.  The
  KlimaLogg is not a 'standard' weather station, so the graphs and reports
  in skin Standard will not work properly.


Reading of historical records

The Klimalogg Pro can store over 50,000 records.  If the logger is full it
can take some time to download the records.  For example, on a Raspberry Pi 1B,
reading 51143 records took 15 hours.  Systems with faster I/O will probably
take considerably less time.
